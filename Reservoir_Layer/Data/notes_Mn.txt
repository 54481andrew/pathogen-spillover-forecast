Hi Elisabeth, 

I have some questions and updates on the Mastomys natalensis capture data-set that is used in the Lassa forecast paper. I cleaned up the original dataset you sent for the revisions. Now, the workbook only has entries from West Africa that were given "high" confidence in their ID. For the manuscript, I'm only keeping natalensis captures that have a literature reference to back them up -- this leaves out personal communication, and Teruren Museum entries. I hope that's OK; I think it will be easier to get by the reviewers. I'm trying to provide full references and DOI's in the data-set, but ran into a few questions. 

Could you look through the attached Excel workbook and answer the questions I have? They fall into 3 categories: 

1. A long time ago I added Colangelo, 2013 to the rodent data. I cannot seem to find information on when these surveys took place. Do you happen to know? I don't believe it's in the article or genbank. Also, the lat/lon were not reported in the paper. I found many locations from your data-base, and the remaining by computer (python). Are you able to confirm or update the lat/lon that were found by computer? 

2. There are a few references (i.e., Duplantier, 2009) for which I cannot figure out the right paper to reference. For example there are several papers by Duplantier in 2009, and none seem to have capture data from the localities that are listed in the database. 

3. In the original data-base, a few rows were given Confidence == "high", but do not seem to have a gene-based species ID. In the "Diagnosis" column, most of these only seem to be based on morphology (plus other things regarding Lassa ID). Examples: Wulff, 1975; Monath, 1974, etc.
 
I appreciate any help! 
Andrew



Here's the original dataset EFC sent (workbook, M.natalensis sheet). In the workbook I made refinements to the original dataset and saved these as new spreadsheets: _1: removed all entries from outside west africa, added Colangelo, 2013;  _2: removed all entries based on personal communication or only museum, _3: same as 2 but added questions for EFC
